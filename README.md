# 🏅 Olympics Data Analysis — Exploratory Data Insights

## 📍 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Olympic athlete data to uncover meaningful insights about participation trends, performance distribution, gender representation, and event-wise competitiveness. The analysis demonstrates strong data storytelling and visualization skills relevant to real-world analytical scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Analyze athlete participation across different Olympic editions
- Understand medal distribution among categories and countries
- Examine gender-based trends in sports and achievements
- Identify top-performing sports and competitive patterns
- Visualize data to drive insights for decision-making

---

## 📊 Dataset Details
| Dataset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `dataset_olympics.csv` | Athlete-wise Olympic participation and medal data |
| `noc_region.csv` | Mapping of National Olympic Committee codes to countries/regions |

Both datasets were cleaned, merged, structured, and validated for accurate insight generation.

---

## 🔍 Major Insights
- Steady rise in athlete participation over decades
- Strong gender imbalance historically, narrowing in recent years
- Certain sports show higher medal conversion probability
- Clear dominance of selected regions in global performance metrics

> Detailed insights and visual charts are included in the notebook.
